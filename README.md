# PySpark on macOS: installation and use

## Install dependencies:

### install dependencies is with homebrew (in my opinion the best package manager for MacOS).
To install homebrew, you only need to copy this in your terminal:

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

### install java
brew install java 

### install apache-spark
brew install apache-spark

brew info apache-spark
